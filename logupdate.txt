succesfully hosted the webapp on Render.com. But performance is low given that it's free hosting
Migrated the project to Microsoft Azure instead. Azure provides 12 monthes of free hosting so going to utilize that for now.
Everything besides latency measurment works. Link to site
Render: https://testyspeedy.onrender.com/ (Down due to azure migration)
Azure: https://speedytesty-hsffeydmarbva3gx.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/

The webapp however is incomplete due to the fact that net measurment works differently when it is being hosted from a non-local host.
  To be implemented:
    - App measures the speed of the host not the client
    - Latency measurment doesn't work due to (guessing) security policies the host services have
